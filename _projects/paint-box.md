## About
A graduation present for a friend, who earned her Bachelor's in 2017.

Giselle and I made a wooden box for some store-bought iridescent paints. We used leftover pieces of red oak from another project, and stained it a dark walnut colorn. The slots for the paints and paintbrush were milled out on a Bridgeport milling machine. There are neodymium magnets under the brass corner plates, to keep the box closed when not in use.

We etched a nameplate from brass sheet with ferric chloride, using a similar resist phototransfer technique as in DIY PCB etching. Soaking it in vinegar and then lightly sanding the raised surfaces gave it an antiqued finish.
